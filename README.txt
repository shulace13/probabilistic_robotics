# probabilistic_robotics

This git is to keep track of the work that I've done.
The text book that I am using is "Probabilistic Robotics" written by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox.

I do not know how frequently I can update this repository and how far I can go, but feel free to watch. :/
